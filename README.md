# Scripts

Welcome to our Scripts repository for our class project!

The Automation ADDS scipt is our compiled scipt that will set up the ADDS and its roles while also creating OU's and fills in our user's to their respective OU's according to the requirements of our project.

The AddNewADUser will allow us to add new users and assign them OU's for onboarding new employees.
